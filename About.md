### [The official Academic Calendar at UVA Registrar](http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/calendar.html)

### Course Basics:

+ TuTh 9:30am - 10:45PM  
+ Rice 340


### General Description and Disclaimer: 

+ It is quite hard to make important topics of Generative AI fit on a one-semester schedule.  We aim to make the course reasonably digestible in an seminar team-learning manner. Our goals here are to highlight the most timing research topics relating to GenAI risks and benefits, and to expose the trade-offs. We think this teaching style provides students with research centered learning on both knowledge and workflows, helping them build a quick understanding of State-of-the-Art in GenAI.



### Prerequisite:

+ Required courses as prerequisites: Machine Learning; Deep learning. The seminar is for research-focused graduate students with interests in deep learning, privacy, fairness, security, and related topics. Instructor permission is required to enroll, and decisions about enrollment will be based on what you are able to bring to the seminar.


### Course Expectations

Students in the seminar are expected to:

+ Lead discussions on interesting topics during the class meetings. For each week, there will be a team of students charged with preparing a topic, making slide deck and leading the discussion, and another team charged with writing a blog post about the class. Students responsible for posting the blog summary will be different from the ones charged with leading the topic discussion, but should work closely with the leaders on the posted write-up.

+ Participate actively in class meetings. This means being prepared to contribute by doing the assigned preparation (which will typically involve reading a few research papers, but may involve other things also) and thinking about the materials deeply to be able to contribute well to discussions. Part of this preparation will involve responding in writing to questions posed before the class.

#### Course QA Slack Space 

+ Course Slack Space: We use Course Slack for office hour assistances and QA discussions.  This is the place where you can seek help, offer help, share your thoughts and discoveries, or discuss technical difficulties and potential troubleshooting on the assignments. 


### Course Grading Policy
  The grade will be calculated as follows:
+ Five Presentation Assignments (50%, with five slide decks (google slide) and reading sessions to lead )
+ Five Blogpost Assignments: (50% with five blogposts to write, each blogpost (github pages post) is about one reading session)  


#### Leading Team Schedule

As the leading team, your job is to select a worthwhile topic, decide on a reading assignment (which can include things other than reading and is not limited to typical research papers) for the class, write questions that the class should write responses to in preparation for the discussion, and lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating class!

You have two class sessions to present your topic (Tues and Thurs meetings), so please don’t just give a series of unconnected, dull presentations. You need to think of things to do in class to make it more worthwhile and engaging. Some of your class may be presenting ideas using slides, but you should aim to also include other things such as whiteboard presentations, code demos, class discussions, class activities, etc.

Two weeks before your team is scheduled to lead, you should have an idea what you want to do, tentative list of readings or other materials, and send this to instructor by 5:29pm on the Monday. We will give you some quick feedback on this, and we can meet after class on Tuesday to discuss.

One week before your team is scheduled to lead, you should post the materials for the week, including the response questions or activities, on the course discussion site. So, the team leading on 02/12 September should do this by 0205 at 5:29pm.

For teams leading the first few weeks, this schedule is not possible, so is adjusted in the schedule below. The team leading 01/23 will get a rough plan from instrutors on the first class, and submit a plan for posting by 5:29pm on 01/22. The team leading the second week 01/30 should decide on a general plan for the week and send it to instrutors by 5:29pm on 01/27. Then, the materials should be ready for posting by 01/29.

After you’ve completed the class meeting, you should help the Blogging team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions, and reviewing their write-up.

Preparation Deadlines

All deadlines are at 5:29pm on the date listed.


#### Blogging Team

The blogging team is responsible for writing a post that summarizes the materials and discussion for the class. A draft of the blog should be submitted as a pull request no later than the following Monday (so the blog for the week of 02/13 is due on Monday 02/19.

Before the scheduled class, develop a team plan for how to manage the blogging. One team member should be designated the team leader for the blogging. The blogging leader is responsible for making sure the team is well coordinated and everyone knows what they are doing and follows through on this. The blogging team should take detailed notes (this can be distributed among the team — make sure you know who is responsible for taking notes on each part).

Note that as the blogging team, you are not expected to post responses or questions this week (although you may if you want to, of course), but you are still expected to participate actively in the class.

By the Monday following class, have a draft of the blog post ready, and share it with the rest of the class (including the leading team and coordinators) for comments. Instructions for how to prepare the blog post are on the Blogging Mechanics page.

By the following Friday, have a final version of the blog post ready to add to the course site.

#### Text Book
+ No text book. Many many papers to read ..


### Academic Integrity
The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 


Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud. Each assignment will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you are in doubt regarding the requirements, please consult with me before you complete any requirement of this course. Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Send, receiving or otherwise copying electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam, as well as a full letter-grade penalty on the course grade. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks. 


### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at [URL](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff). 

If you have been identified as an SDAC student, please let the Center know you are taking this class. If you suspect you should be an SDAC student, please schedule an appointment with them for an evaluation. Students who need academic accommodations should see me and contact the SDAC. All academic accommodations must be arranged through the SDAC. 

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.) please contact instructor and/or TA as soon as you know these may affect you in class. 


### Religious Accommodations
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. 

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance. 


### Statement on Violence
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:

Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence. 

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help. 

### This syllabus
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.
